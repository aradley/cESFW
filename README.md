# cESFW
cESFW is a feature correlation software based on the principles of Entropy Sorting. 

The theory underpinning cESFW if outlined in the following publications:

[Entropy sorting of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals the inner cell mass in the human pre-implantation embryo](https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(22)00456-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671122004568%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

[Branching topology of the human embryo transcriptome revealed by entropy sort feature weighting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.12.562031v2)

### Example workflows

To find example workflows/vignettes for using cESFW, please go to our accompanying [cESFW_Embryo_Topology_Paper](https://github.com/aradley/cESFW_Embryo_Topology_Paper/tree/main) repository.

### Installation
1. Retreive the ripository with: `git clone https://github.com/aradley/cESFW.git`
2. Navigate to the directory where the clone was downloaded to, for example: `cd cESFW/`
3. Run the following on the command line: `python setup.py install`
